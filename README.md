## Project Overview

The **Global census analysis report** aims to provide insights on the progression or regression in population numbers in various countries according to census held so far since 1970 till date(2022).Through analysis of the world population data set,we can see population growth in some countries/regions an regression in others,giving us a comprehensive view of the performance of various contries population-wise in the last decades.Insights derived from this analysis will help in evaluation of natality and mortality rates,survival rates,overpopulation,so on and inform decision making process

## Tools Used

. **SQL server management studio**:To analyse data and create insights

. **PowerBi Desktop**:To visualize outcomes

## Questions Answered in Analysis Process using SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS)

1 What country has the highest population growth rate?

2 What country was most populated in 2022?

3 What continent has the highest growth rate?

4 What was the population state in Argentina between the 2000-2022?

## Visualization in PowerBi

. After the data cleaning and analysis process was completed,the results were exported to XLX file which served as the basis for creating an insightful and visually appealing dashboard

. The purpose of the PowerBi dashboard was to provide better understanding of the insights generated in analysis of this study

## Findings
**Top 5 most populated countries**
. China
. India
. United states
. Indonesia
. Pakistan

. **Asia remains the most populated continent**

.**Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa**

. The population of Africa reduced in 2020 most likely due to the Covid19 pandemic
